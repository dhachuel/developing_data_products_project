## Shiny Weather App

This purpose of this presentation is to give an overview of the course project.

## The Problem

Every morning you wake up and want to know what your day is going to be like. Weather conditions are something we always lookup in the morning. Sure enough, there are tons of weather services/products/apps that will provide the required information. But here is what doesn't work for me:

1. They display too much information that is not needed
2. They are limited to city wide location selection
3. Looking up a place usually takes several cumbersome clicks
4. They don't usually show you more specific location data (like a map)

---

## The Solution

A good weather app must be simple and fast to use. It needs to let the user look up locations quickly and effortlessly.

## Demo

The script does the following:
- Get location input
- Makes an API request to Google geo api and gets lat and lng coordinates
- Makes another API request to openweathermap to get weather data for those coordinates
- Generates a Leaflet map for those coordenates and displays weather info

Here is the raw HTML output:
```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE,render=TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(leaflet)
library(RCurl)
library(rjson)
library(R2HTML)

location <- "New York, 10014"

location <- gsub(pattern = " ", replacement = "%20", x = location)
    
    # Base geolocation Google API endpoint
    ggapi_url <- "http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address="
    
    # Get coordinates and address from zip code
    geo_data <- fromJSON(getURL(url = paste(ggapi_url, location, sep='')))
    formatted_address <- geo_data[1]$results[[1]]$formatted_address
    lat <- as.numeric(geo_data[1]$results[[1]]$geometry$bounds$northeast$lat)
    lng <- as.numeric(geo_data[1]$results[[1]]$geometry$bounds$northeast$lng)
    
    # Get weather data from OpenWeatherMap
    weather_url <- paste(
      "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=",
      lat,
      "&lon=",
      lng,
      sep='')
    weather_data <- fromJSON(getURL(url = weather_url))
    weather.main <- weather_data$weather[[1]]$main
    weather.description <- weather_data$weather[[1]]$description
    weather.temp <- round(weather_data$main$temp - 273.15,1) # Celcius scale
    weather.unit <- "C"
    
    weather.icon <- paste(
      "http://openweathermap.org/img/w/",
      weather_data$weather[[1]]$icon,
      ".png",
      sep=''
    )
    
    
    content <- paste(
      sep = "",
      paste("<center><h2>",formatted_address,"</h2></center>",sep=''),
      paste("<center><img src='",weather.icon,"'></center>",sep=''),
      paste("<center><h1>",weather.temp," &#186",weather.unit,"</h1></center>",sep=''),
      paste("<center><strong>",weather.main,"</strong>: ",weather.description,"</center>",sep='')
    )

    cat(formatted_address)
    cat("\n")
    cat(paste(weather.temp," ÂºC",weather.unit,"",sep=''))
    cat("\n")
    cat(paste(weather.main,": ",weather.description,sep=''))
#     
#     map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%  addPopups(lng, lat, content,options = popupOptions(closeButton = FALSE)
#       )
#   map
```
